# Community Fridge Webmap

This repository contains a map that shows the community fridge locations in New York. Community fridge counts are constantly in flux, so it is possible that the webmap is missing some fridges/some of the fridges have been decommissioned. This webmap is an extension of community fridge research that I did the winter of 2020.
