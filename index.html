            Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people across the country lost their jobs due to stay at home orders and the shuttering of entire industries. Here in New York City, job recovery has been slow. The increase unemployment rate across NYC, and other cities across the world, has incited higher rates of food insecurity. Mutual aid and community organizations have played a huge role in helping those in need get through the pandemic. This disaster has inspired the creation of community fridges, which are fridges in public spaces that are open for anyone to take or supply food. These fridges have popped-up all across the city.
